Don't just add a new language, 50 is a lot. Do something new or continuate only if the thing you want to continue is not fully done or not fully documented.
- Don't document the code ONLY
With code we mean the code that is in the `src` folder and the things with actual code, not documentation or all of that. If you do it, Please, make a new doc or do something else.
