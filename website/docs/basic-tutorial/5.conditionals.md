# Conditionals & loops

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use conditionals and loops in Nain.

## What are conditionals?

Conditionals check if a certain condition is true or false.

They are used to make decisions in the program.

For example, you might want to print a message if the user's age is greater than 18.

Now, you will use something like an `if` or `switch` for longer decisions.

But for now, let's see how to use `if` conditionals.

```nain
fn main() {
    let age = 18
    if age > 18 { // if the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces will be executed
        print!("You are old enough to vote!")
    }
}
```

As you can see, the condition is written after the `if` keyword, followed by a space, and then the code inside the curly braces.

But, what if we want to check multiple conditions, or if it is false?

We can use the `elif` and `else` keywords to check multiple conditions.

`else` will check if the condition is **not** true.
If it isn't true, the code inside the `else` block will be executed.

But if we needed to check multiple conditions, we can use `elif`.

`elif` stands for "else if". It will check if the condition specified after `elif` is true, and if it is, the code inside the block will be executed.

## Operators

Operators are used to compare values.

There are several operators in Nain, but the most common ones are:

-   `==` : checks if two values are equal
-   `===` : checks if two values are equal and of the same type
-   `!=` : checks if two values are not equal
-   `!==` : checks if two values are not equal and of the same type
-   `>` : checks if the first value is greater than the second value
-   `=>` : checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value
-   `<` : checks if the first value is less than the second value
-   `<=` : checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second value

You can use these operators in `if` conditionals.
They are used between two values, like this:

```nain
if value1 == value2 {
    // code
} elif value1 > value2 {
    // code
} elif value1 < value2 {
    // code
}
```

For example:

```nain
fn main() {
    let age = 18
    if age >= 18 { // if the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces will be executed
        print!("You are old enough to vote!")
    } elif age == 17 {
        print!("Sorry, one more year to go!")
    } else {
        print!("You are too young to vote!")
    }
}
```

There are more operators, they are not common, but I'll show you some of them here.

| Name   | Description                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&`   | Logical AND                                           |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR                                            |
| `!!`   | Logical NOT                                           |
| `^`    | Bitwise XOR                                           |
| `&`    | Bitwise AND                                           |
| '+=='  | If the value +1 is equal to the value                 |
| '+!='  | If the value +1 is not equal to the value             |
| '+>'   | If the value +1 is greater than the value             |
| '+>='  | If the value +1 is greater than or equal to the value |
| '+<'   | If the value +1 is less than the value                |
| '+<='  | If the value +1 is less than or equal to the value    |

## Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

There are two types of loops in Nain:

-   `while` loops
-   `for` loops

### While loops

A `while` loop will repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

They have the same syntax as `if` conditionals: `while condition { //code }`.

For example:

```nain
fn main() {
    let answer = 535
    let guess = readInt()
    while answer != guess {
        print!("Wrong!")
        guess = readInt()
    }
}
```

On the example, we read the user's answer, and we check if it is equal to the answer.

If it isn't, we print a message and ask the user to guess again.

### For loops

A `for` loop will repeat a block of code a certain number of times.
They are like a shortcut for while loops, but more powerful (and complex).

At first, they will look intimidating, but they are very simple to use.

They consist of three parts:

-   iterator variable
-   condition
-   after iteration

The iterator variable is the variable that will be used to count the number of times the loop will repeat.

The condition is the condition that will be checked before each iteration.

After each iteration, the code inside the `for` loop will be executed.
And after every iteration, the iterator variable will be changed by the after iteration code.

Let's see an example:

```nain
fn main() {
    for let i:int = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1 { // the iterator variable is i, the condition is i < 10, and the after iteration code is i = i + 1
        print!(i) // prints the value of i, so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    }
}
```

## Exercise

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
One with a `for` loop and one with a `while` loop.
