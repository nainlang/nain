# Variables

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use variables in Nain.

## 1.1 Declaring variables

To declare a variable, you need to use the `let` keyword.
:::info
You can also use the `var` keyword, but it's not recommended as they can be accesed outside the program scope.
:::

```nain
let a = 10
```

## 1.2 Assigning values to variables

After declaring a variable, you can assign a value to it.

:::tip
You can use the `=` operator to assign values to variables.
:::

```nain
let a = 10
print!(a) // prints 10
a = 20
print!(a) // prints 20
```

## 1.3 Using variables

After assigning a value to a variable, you can use them as if they were numbers or strings.

```nain
let a = 10
print!(a) // prints 10
print!("The value of a is "..a) // prints The value of a is 10
```

:::tip
Use the concatenation operator (`..`) to concatenate strings.
E.J:

```nain
let a = "Hi"
let b = "There"
print!(a..b) // prints Hi There
```

:::

## 1.4 Updating variables

You can update the value of a variable by using the `=` operator.

For example, let's say we have a variable `a` with the value `10`.

We could update its value to `20` by using the following code:

```nain
let a = 10
a = 20
```

This would update the value of `a` to `20`.

## 1.5 Declaring multiple variables

You can declare multiple variables at once by separating them with a comma.

```nain
// bad
let a = 10
let b = 20
let c = 30
//good
let a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
```

## 1.6 Data types

An important concept in programming is the data type.
A data type is a classification of data that determines its properties and operations.

There are several data types in Nain, including:

---

| Data type  | Description                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int        | Whole numbers                                                         |
| float      | Decimals                                                              |
| bool       | True or False                                                         |
| char       | Single character                                                      |
| string     | Strings                                                               |
| array      | Ordered unchangable and unrepeatable collection of values             |
| tuple      | Unordered collection of values                                        |
| enum       | Also called `enquadernations`, they store a set of values             |
| inf        | Infinity                                                              |
| nil        | Null                                                                  |
| notanum    | Not a number                                                          |
| -inf       | Negative infinity                                                     |
| zerotozero | Zero divided zero, operating with infinity or other imposible numbers |
| function   | Functions                                                             |

---

## 1.7 Using data types

To use a data type, you need to declare a variable with that data type.

For example, let's say we want to store a number in a variable.
We can declare a variable with the `int` data type like this:

```nain
let a = 10
```

Now, we can use the variable `a` as a number.

:::tip
For better readibility, use the `:` operator to declare a variable with a data type.
E.J:

```nain
let a: int = 10 // same as let a = 10, but now you know it is not a float for example
```
