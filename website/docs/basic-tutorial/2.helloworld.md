# Make a Hello World program!

In this tutorial, we'll make a simple "Hello World" program.

Let's start by creating a new file called `hello.nain`.

```bash
touch hello.nain
```

Now, let's open the file in our favorite text editor.

For this tutorial, we'll use VSCode.

Open your file on your favorite text editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, etc.).

Now, let's start writing our program!

First, we need the `studio` library.
:::info
The `studio` library is a collection of functions that are used to interact with i/o, and to let functions access the memory outside of the program.
:::

```nain
with lib studio
```

Next, we'll write the `main` function.

:::info
A function is a block of code that can be called from anywhere in the program.
The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
:::

```nain
fn main() {

}
```

Next, we'll write the `print!` function.
:::info
The `print!` function is used to print text to the console.
It is a built-in function that is available to all programs.
:::

```nain
print!("Hello World!")
```

And, voila! We've made a "Hello World" program!

Run the program by running the following command:

```bash
nain dev r hello.nain
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
$ nain dev r hello.nain
|---Info----------|
| version: 0.1.0  |
| file: hello.nain|
|-----------------|

--Output-----
Hello World!
```

:::tip
To hide the useless info, use the `--quiet` flag.

```bash
nain dev r --quiet hello.nain
```

The output should be:

```bash
$ nain dev r --quiet hello.nain
Hello World!
```
