# Installation

Installation is pretty easy, just follow the steps below:

## Linux

We have a package for (almost) every distro, so you can install it with your package manager.

If there isn't, build it from source or use the flatpak.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo snap install nain-debian
```

### Arch

```bash
sudo yay -S nain-arch
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install nain-fedora
```

### NixOs

```bash
sudo nix-env -iA nixos.nain
```

**OR**

Add the following to your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    nain-nix
    # Your other packages here
]
```

## Windows

Download the `nain.msi` file in the [latest release](https://github.com/nainlang/nain/releases/latest).

## MacOS

Download the `nain.dmg` file from the `bins` folder in the [latest release](https://github.com/nainlang/nain/releases/latest).

## BSD

### FreeBSD

Use `pkg`

```sh
pkg install nain-freebsd
```

### OpenBSD

Use `pkg_add`

```sh
pkg_add nain-openbsd
```

### NetBSD

Use `pkgin`

```sh
pkgin install nain-netbsd
```

## Source

If you use a non-supported os or want instant updates, you can build from source.

To build from source, you need to have the following dependencies:

-   Clang (GCC is not supported, as llvm is used)
-   LLVM
-   Make (GNU Make is supported)
-   Git

Then, you can build it with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nainlang/nain.git
cd nain
make
```

:::tip
Building from source has the latest development releases, change the branch to use a stable release if you want with:

```bash
git checkout stable
```
